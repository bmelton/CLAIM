This doesn't work yet.  It can read messages and all that, but 
whenever I try to publish, it just pisses on me. 

I'll get to it, but it was a pastime one day during a class, 
so don't expect quickness.

To run: 
 - First run 'login.py' -- this will prompt for your credentials
   and store them in an encoded file (settings.dat).  Note, this
   is not especially secure or anything, it's just encoded to pre-
   vent casual viewing. 

 - Then run 'aim.py' -- This will read in your credentials and 
   log you in to AIM, hopefully.
